# First-Bayesian-Inference
## :star: Purpose
This Shiny App is designed to ease its users first contact with Bayesian statistical inference, investigate the effect of different prior distributions on the posterior result, and understand prior-data conflict. By "pointing and clicking", the user can analyze the IQ-example as has been used in the easy-to-go introduction to Bayesian inference of van de Schoot et al. (2013). Different prior distributions can be specified, and data with different characteristics can be simulated on the fly. 

The Shiny app is available at: [https://utrecht-university.shinyapps.io/bayesian_estimation/](https://utrecht-university.shinyapps.io/bayesian_estimation/).

## :gem: How can you profit from it?
First of all, this app might be a useful tool for your teaching if you would like to familiarize your students with the basic logic of Bayesian inference. Second, feel free to use this material as a template for your own app.
